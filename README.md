# never_ending-python-calculator
This Python script implements a calculator that allows users to perform multiple calculations continuously without restarting the program.


**How it Works**

The script defines functions for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The operations are stored in a dictionary, where keys are arithmetic symbols and values are corresponding functions.
The calculator function displays the logo and prompts the user to enter the first number.
It then displays available operations and allows the user to pick one.
The user enters the second number and the calculation is performed using the selected operation.
The result is displayed, and the user can choose to continue with the result or start a new calculation.

Enjoy performing endless calculations with ease using the Never-EndingÂ Calculator!
